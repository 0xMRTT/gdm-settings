# gdm-settings

An uncomplete app to change/manage settings, theme and background of Gnome's Display/Login Manager. Currently, it is in very early stage of development and does nothing.

It is supposed to be a alternative written in Python to [gdm-tools](https://github.com/realmazharhussain/gdm-tools.git) written in bash.

**Additionally**, it is supposed to have a Graphical interface as well.
